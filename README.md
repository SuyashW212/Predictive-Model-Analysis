# Predictive-Model-Analysis
Best predictive model to study the impact of demographic and employment factors on income range. 
• Objective: In this project, assessed various predictive models to analyze the impact of demographic and employment 
factors on income classification. Identified key predictors influencing income levels. 
• Outcome: The analysis revealed that age significantly influences income, with a positive correlation between age and 
higher income. Random Forest outperformed other models, providing robust performance with high recall, precision, and 
accuracy, making it ideal for deployment. 
• Key skills: Python (Libraries: pandas, sklearn, smote), Machine learning (Logistic regression, Decision Tree and Random 
forest), ensemble technique, model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall and confusion matrix.
